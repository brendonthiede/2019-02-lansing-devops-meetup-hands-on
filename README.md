# Lansing DevOps Meetup - Hands-on Workshop

## Summary

This was begun from an Azure DevOps Project template for a Node JS app. The app itself will not be anything exciting.

## Usage

There are two node projects (Applications and Tests), an ARM template, and helper scripts. Descriptions of each are below.

### Node Application

To start the app locally, you should be able to just change to the `Application` directory and executing the following:

```bash
cd Application
npm install
npm run start:debug
```

If you find the debugging output to be too much, you can just run `npm run start`. Once the app has started, you can reach it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Node Tests

There are both Unit Tests and Functional Tests. The unit tests run against a localhost server on port 4000 and can be run to output to the console, or to create JUnit output as a file.  Typically, for local development you would want to run the unit tests with console output and in a CI environment, you would want the JUnit output. Functional tests run against a running instance of the app. For local development you would most likely run against the app running at http://localhost:3000 while the functional tests that run as part of the deployment process run against the URL for the deployed environment. Note that you will need to run the Application npm install prior to running the unit tests as below.

#### Unit tests with console output

```bash
cd Tests
npm install
npm run unittest
```

#### Unit tests with JUnit output

```bash
cd Tests
npm install
npm run unittest:report
```

#### Functional tests with console output

```bash
cd Tests
npm install
npm run functionaltest
```

#### Functional tests with JUnit output

```bash
cd Tests
npm install
npm run functionaltest:report
```

## ARM Templates

The ARM template will be used to create an App Service in Azure.

## Helper Scripts

The `scripts` folder has scripts that can help with the CI/CD pipeline.
